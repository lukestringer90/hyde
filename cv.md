## Career Summary

* **2018: Head of Development at [3Squared](http://3squared.com)**.
    * Lead a cross-discipline team of 25 developers (.NET, iOS, Android) to build the RailSmart suite of logistics and operations software for the UK Rail Industry.
	* Unified the web and mobile disciplines into a single department, with a shared vision, leadership and management structure.
	* Recruited at multiple levels (Graduates to Senior Engineers), growing the team by 50% during the first year of my leadership.
	* Implemented a graduate scheme to train junior developers. Oversaw four graduates through to subsequent promotion.
	* Embedded a technical strategy to facilitate move to SaaS, focusing on simpler, consistent tech stacks and approaches, across different platforms and 25+ codebases.
	* Standardised implementations using reusable packages with SPM, NPM, NuGet. Implemented this across the product suite, in both new and old projects.
	* Planned and managed multiple technology transitions including CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager, ASP.NET Web Forms to Vue.JS, Octopus Deploy to Azure DevOps, on-prem GitLab to GitHub.
	* Managed and forecasted resource for upcoming projects, selected the right team members based on technical and soft skills.
	* Mentored developers new to management and leadership to grow them professionally, allowing me to manage the larger team through them.
	* Defined the web API architecture to integrate with large, legacy systems at Network Rail. Worked with internal and external technical teams to implement a phased approach to integration with our applications, with longer terms goals to offer the solution as a product to the wider market.
	* Managed a quick transition into remote work in March 2020. I adapted the my communication style and the team structure to better suit remote work, and supported team members both professionally and personally during the pandemic.
	* Planned the transition to Federated Identity for our SaaS products. Identified the complexities and dependencies between our web and mobile apps, backend APIs and a centralised identity server, aligning these with infrastructure, testing, UX, and cost considerations.
	* Regularly a part of sales and business development activity. Worked on bid and tender documentation to win big contracts with Network Rail and HS2. Defined technical approach to delivering software in multi-year iterations.

	* Lead a team of 6 iOS and Android developers, supporting and guiding both their technical and professional development through 1-2-1s, goal setting and appraisals.
	* Planned and managed the transition from Objective-C to Swift (starting at version 2.2). I identified the right commercial opportunities and staff, got sign off on the business case, and ensured the projects delivered on time while using the new language and approaches.
	* Defined Swift best practice and interoperability with Objective-C, getting agreement within the team. All new projects used 100% Swift since 2017, and older, larger Objective-C codebases were gradually re-written - now 75% in Swift by 2021.
	* Standardised iOS components into small, reusable packages using CocoaPods so they can be used across multiple projects. Open sourced these as "The Peak Framework" on GitHub.
	* Technical leadership to deliver projects with tight timelines and a challenging clients. I worked as a developer on these projects while overseeing the technical delivery with the project management, updating clients and external stakeholders where required.
	* Worked with Operational Management Team to implement new policies such as Agile rituals, standardised appraisal approaches, and inclusive recruitment principles.
	* Responsible for managing the companies App Store Connect and Enterprise Developer Accounts, as well as supporting the setup and admin of customers Apple accounts and MDMs.
	* Implemented automated builds to save time and reduce build errors. I wrote a set of Ruby scripts to call xcodebuild and standardise how all iOS projects were built, versioned and signed. I configured Team City to run these scripts on a Git push, and deploy the apps for internal testing and App Store release.
* **2014: Senior iOS Software Engineer at [3Squared](http://3squared.com)**.
	* Mentored placement students and new members of the mobile development team, designed induction projects and trained them in our best practices.
	* Training the team in writing unit tests and TDD where appropriate for business logic.
	* Trained the team in Git and implemented a code review policy using GitFow and GitLab.
	* Estimated and planned the software architecture of new products.
	* Built multiple native iOS apps from scratch in the RailSmart Suite. Focused on data synchronisation performance, researching and implementing the best approaches to use Core Data, web API calls and JSON serialisation.
	* Completed a research project with Crossrail using iBeacons and Core Location, implementing trilateration to determine user position. I worked with the client to understand requirements, ran trials at the Bond Street construction site, and wrote up my findings in a report.
* **2012: iOS Software Engineer at [3Squared](http://3squared.com)**.
	* Developed iOS apps for a number of clients in Health Insurance, Hospitality, Constriction and Rail Freight.
	* Used Objective-C, Core Data, Storyboards, and integrated with RESTful and SOAP XML APIs.
	
## Personal Projects
* **2021: [Pivot for iOS](http://getpivot.app)**. 
	* After being unable to find an app to build Excel-style pivot tables I decided to build one myself.
	* Used Swift to to create an algorithm to parse a CSV file into a configurable pivot table. Reverse engineered requirements from Excel and implemented following TDD principles. Open sourced as PeakPivot and integrated as a swift package into Pivot.
	* Used UIDocumentBrowser to load CSV files and save custom ".pivot" files back to file providers.
	* Used RevenueCat for server side receipt validation, implementing a one time in-app-purchase unlocking all features after a 7 day free trial.

## Publications
### [University Of Shefﬁeld: Two Approaches to Semantic Text Similarity](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S/S12/S12-1097.pdf)
 
> This paper describes the University of Shefﬁeld’s submission to SemEval-2012 Task 6: Semantic Text Similarity. Two approaches were developed. The ﬁrst is an unsupervised technique based on the widely used vector space model and information from WordNet. The second method relies on supervised machine learning and represents each sentence as a set of n-grams. This approach also makes use of information from WordNet. Results from the formal evaluation show that both approaches are useful for determining the similarity in meaning between pairs of sentences with the best performance being obtained by the supervised approach. Incorporating information from WordNet also improves performance for both approaches.
 
### [Bird Sightings Journal iPhone App](http://www.dcs.sheffield.ac.uk/intranet/archive/public/2010_2011/projects/ug/aca08ls.html) (Undergraduate Dissertation)

> Bird watching has long been a passion of millions of people around Great Britain. The traditional combination of bird reference book, notebook and pencil are a tried and tested method of gathering accurate bird sighting information. With the invention of mobile computer technology, specifically in the field of smartphones, the opportunity for bringing bird watching into the modern age has never been greater. The project aims to bridge the analogue and digital mediums by conceptualising, designing, implementing and then evaluating a mobile software product for identifying and logging bird sightings. The software product should have good usability metrics by following respected usability engineering practises, and also provide a excellent bird information repository comparable to that of a conventional bird reference book.


## Qualifications

* 2012: First Class Masters Degree (with honours) in Software Engineering from The University Of Sheffield.
* 2008: 3.5 A-levels in Mathematics, Physics and Applied ICT from Sheffield Hillsborough College.
